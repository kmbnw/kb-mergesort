An attempt to replicate *NIX sort in Scala.  Done mostly as a learning exercise, 
but hopefully useful.  

Please note that this is still under development.  Some tests exist, but they 
have been based on random collections of dictionary words.  Currently, only 
the following options are supported:

--field-separator  The file field separator.  Default: , (comma)
--key A comma separated list of key columns, starting at 1.  Default: 1 (sort on first column)
--sort-size The maximum number of records to sort in-memory at once.  Default: 10000
--merge-size The maximum number of files to merge at once.  Default: 32
--reverse Reverse the sort order.

All options require an '=' sign after them, and short options are currently not 
supported.

If you did not receive these files from github.com/kmbnw/kb-mergesort, you 
may have an old, corrupted, or malicious version of the software.

If you have any questions please contact Krysta Bouzek (nwkrystab on google).
